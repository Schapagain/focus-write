# Focus Write
A distraction-free [text editor](https://focus-write.netlify.app/). 

I built this editor because I needed a place to do random writing practices, and didn't wanna use any of the feature-laden note-taking apps or text editors on the web. 
All this application is meant to do is give you a space to write.

> Note: The web app saves documents to your browser storage. 
What this means is no installation or signups necessary to save your documents, but the downside is that the documents can disapper if you clear your browser cache.
